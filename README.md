### Reddit Bot
"BeckettBot" is the bot aimed at supporting the institution of Claremont Mckenna College in its political and academic endeavors.

[Here you can veiw my favorite interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r0yi9l/comment/hm597ov/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on the subreddit BotTown2, which was created after the origional subreddit got banned. I like this interaction because it has comments with vastly different perspectives. One promotes CMC, another AOC, and another Donny T; The rhyming is on point!

#### Score

I think i should get a 28/30 on this assignment. Sadly, since the max number of comments that I posted was stuck at 1000, and I had some invalid comments that I couldn't figure out how to get rid of, I was only able to get to 792 valid replies. If the maximum allowed comments was extended I definitely would have crossed the 1000 mark, but I still completed the 1st and 2nd extra credit.

I also completed the 4th and 7th extra credit. The 4th is in a seperate python file in the repo, and the 6th is in my code on line 179.
